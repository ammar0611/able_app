# Fix Video Loading Issue

## Problem
Videos are not loading with error: "UnimplementedError: init() has not been implemented"

## Root Cause
The `video_player` plugin requires native platform code that wasn't properly installed. After adding new native plugins or permissions, you MUST rebuild the app completely.

## Solution - Follow These Steps:

### Step 1: Stop the Current App
Press `q` in the terminal to quit the running app, or stop it from your IDE.

### Step 2: Clean Build Cache
```powershell
flutter clean
```

### Step 3: Get Dependencies
```powershell
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Rebuild and Run
```powershell
flutter run
```

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use hot reload or hot restart. You must completely rebuild and reinstall the app.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Added `INTERNET` permission to AndroidManifest.xml
2. ✅ Added debug logging to reels_screen.dart
3. ✅ Added better loading indicators
4. ✅ Added video player options for mixing audio

## Why This Happens
- Native plugins like `video_player` require platform-specific code
- Hot reload only updates Dart code, not native code
- A full rebuild is required to:
  - Install native plugin code
  - Update Android/iOS project files
  - Register new permissions

## Testing After Rebuild
1. Login with: `participant@test.com` / `password123`
2. Click "Social/Insta" (pink card #1)
3. Tap "Reels" icon (3rd bottom nav)
4. Videos should now load and play automatically
5. Check terminal for debug logs showing successful initialization

## Alternative: Run on Different Device
If still having issues, try:
```powershell
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## Video URLs Being Used
All videos are from Google Cloud Storage test bucket:
- BigBuckBunny.mp4
- ElephantsDream.mp4
- ForBiggerBlazes.mp4
- ForBiggerEscapes.mp4
- ForBiggerFun.mp4
- ForBiggerJoyrides.mp4
- ForBiggerMeltdowns.mp4
- Sintel.mp4

These are reliable test videos that should work once the plugin is properly installed.
